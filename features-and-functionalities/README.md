It exposes **RESTful or GraphQL APIs** that are consumed by web and mobile clients.

### **Primary Modules**
- User Authentication & Authorization  
- Property Management  
- Booking & Reservation System  
- Payment Processing  
- Review & Rating System  
- Notification System  
- Admin Management Dashboard  

## 2. System Architecture 

### **Main Components**
- **API Gateway**
- **Authentication Service**
- **User Service**
- **Property Service**
- **Booking Service**
- **Payment Service**
- **Notification Service**
- **Database(s):** SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) + optional Redis for caching

#### **Entities**
```plaintext
Property: {id, host_id, Name, description, address, latitude, longitude, price_per_night, max_guests, amenities[], photos[], created_at}
Property_Photos: {photo_id, property_id, file_url}
Amenities: {amenity_id, name, icon}
Availability: {property_id, date, is_available}
```

#### **Features**
- Host adds/edits/deletes property listings (title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability   ) 
- Upload multiple photos per property  
- Define amenities, availability calendar, pricing  
- Search filters (Location, Number of guests, Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly))  
- View property details 
- Property approval (by Admin)

**Elements:**
- Property Service  
  ↳ Connects to → Property Database  
  ↳ Linked with → User Service (for host info)  
  ↳ Linked with → Booking Service (to check availability)

---

### **C. Booking & Reservation System**

**Purpose:** Allow guests to search, book, and manage stays.  

#### **Entities**
```plaintext
Booking: {booking_id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status, created_at}
Booking_Status: enum {Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled, Completed}

```

#### **Features**
- Search properties by date, Location, Number of guests, Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
- Check real-time availability  
- Cancel booking (with host approval or policy)  
- Generate booking confirmation details  
- Integrate with notifications (email)

**Elements:**
- Booking Service  
  ↳ Connects to → Property Service  
  ↳ Connects to → Payment Service  
  ↳ Connects to → Notification Service  
  ↳ Booking Database  

---

### **D. Payment System**

**Purpose:** Handle secure payments between guests and hosts.  

#### **Entities**
```plaintext
Payment: {Payment_id, booking_id, user_id, amount, currency, payment_status, payment_method, created_at}
Payout: {id, host_id, amount, status}
```

#### **Features**
- Integration with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal)  
- Payment authorization & confirmation  
- Transaction history 

**Draw.io Elements:**
- Payment Service  
  ↳ Connects to → Booking Service (booking_id)  
  ↳ Connects to → External Payment Gateway  
  ↳ Payment Database  

---

### **E. Review & Rating System**

**Purpose:** Build trust via user feedback.  

#### **Entities**
```plaintext
Review: {review_id, booking_id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at}
```

#### **Features**
- Leave review after completed booking  
- Aggregate ratings per property  
- fetching reviews & averages  

**Elements:**
- Review Service ↔ Booking Service ↔ Property Service  

---

### **F. Notification System**

**Purpose:** Notify users about booking updates, payments, and messages.  

#### **Entities**
```plaintext
Notification: {id, user_id, message, type, status, created_at}
```

#### **Features**
- Email notifications (SendGrid or Mailgun)  
- Push notifications for mobile app  
- Booking confirmations
- Cancellations
- Payment updates 

---

### **G. Admin Management**

**Purpose:** Manage platform integrity and compliance.  

#### **Entities**
```plaintext
Admin: {id, email, role, created_at}
```

#### **Features**
- Approve or suspend users & listings  
- Manage site content and support requests  
- Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
    - Users
    - Listings
    - Bookings
    - Payments

## 4. Data Flow Example (Flow Example)

### **User Books a Property**
1. User → Auth Service (verify token)  
2. → Property Service (check availability)  
3. → Booking Service (create booking record)  
4. → Payment Service (process payment)  
5. → Notification Service (send confirmation email)

---

### **Host Adds a New Listing**
1. Host → Auth Service (verify role=host)  
2. → Property Service (add new property)  
3. → File Storage (upload photos)  
4. → Admin Service (optional approval workflow)
